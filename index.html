        </p>
        <p>
          I've been interested in coding for a long time and I'm doing my best
          to develop the skills I'll need to be able to contribute to any team I
          join!
        </p>
        <p>Some of my other interests include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Listening to audiobooks</li>

        </ul>
        <p>
          I eventually plan to put together a portfolio of many of my projects
          on this site, but in the meantime, feel free to

      <!-- About Me -->

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I've been trying to get into the field of software engineering for a
          while. When I was in high school, I wanted to make video games, but
          since college, I've learned it's a tough field to be in. Since then,
          I've worked a variety of jobs in the hospitality industry, but I never
          stopped wanting to become a software engineer.
        </p>

        <p>
          I began learning coding off and on a few years back, but I never put
          that much effort into it until Covid-19 happened. After that, I've
          tried to learn a lot more, but I thought I didn't have the time to go
          to school and learn, so I tried to teach myself online. I was
          side-tracked by earning my AWS Solutions Architect Associate
          certification. Once I got that, I devoted myself to learning coding
          again and eventually made my way to
          <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>
          to try and really boost not just my coding skills, but also my soft
          skills and interviewing skills. So far I've felt so much more
          confident in the program I'm taking than any other course I've done so
          far, so I'm really hopeful for the future!
